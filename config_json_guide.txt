{
  "execution_mode": "async",  // change to "sync" for sequential execution
  "batches": [
    ["file1.py", "file2.py"],  // batches to run
    ["file3.py"]
  ]
}

sync mode will do calls inside a batch one by one
async mode will make cals parallel at the same time. AKA we fire multiple cals at the same time not 1 by 1.
